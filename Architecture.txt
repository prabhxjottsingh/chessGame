Two Players
    |___ Player one
    |___ Player Two
Need to send the move on one player to another player

Thus client is not going to request to server for latest moves of other Players
but the server is itself going to push the latest moves of one to another, thus we will be using WebSocket, not http server.

Websockets => WebSockets are a computer protocol that allows for two-way communication between a user's browser and a server over a single Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection
They are used in apps that require fast, real-time communication, such as chat, dashboard, and game apps.

Create a persistent connection to backend server.
Events that need to be pushed to client:
 1. Whenever a single player makes a move, send the event to server through WebSocket
 2. Now send this event to another player

In the server we will maintain a single variable storing the waiting person, and we will then connect him/her to next
latest coming one.
(on small scale a single vairable is enough, as these are not gonna be multiple request at an instant)
but when in large scale we can maintain something like queue and do our task without the breakage of the application
